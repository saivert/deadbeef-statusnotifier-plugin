## StatusNotifier plugin for the DeaDBeeF music player

### About

This plugin aims to implement the StatusNotifierItem for DeaDBeeF.

It tends to replace default tray icon on DE that supports StatusNotifierIitem protocol.
It also aims to provide tray icon for deadbeef on KDE5/Plasma5, where old xmbedded icons aren't supported anymore. GNOME3 is also partially supported using the [Appindictor Extension](https://github.com/ubuntu/gnome-shell-extension-appindicator).

### Required packages
* `cmake`(optional)
* `gtk 2.x` - for gtk 2 version
* `gtk 3.x` - for gtk 3 version
* `libdbusmenu-glib-0.4` - for dbusmenu
* deadbeef development files. 

#### openSUSE
You will need to add [packman](http://packman.links2linux.org/) repository for deadbeef itself (probably you already done this :) ).
`sudo zypper in cmake deadbeef-devel libdbusmenu-glib-devel gtk3-devel`

#### Fedora
You will need to find any [repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/fulltext/?fulltext=deadbeef) with for deadbeef itself and add it to your system (probably you already done this :) ).
`sudo yum install cmake deadbeef-devel libdbusmenu-devel gtk3-devel`

#### Debian/Ubuntu
You will need to find any [repository](https://launchpad.net/+search?field.text=deadbeef) with for deadbeef itself and add it to your system (probably you already done this :) ).
Package name with development files for deadbeef will depend on selected ppa.

`sudo apt-get install cmake deadbeef-plugins-dev libdbusmenu-glib-dev libgtk-3-dev`

#### Archlinux

`yaourt -S deadbeef-plugin-statusnotifier`

### How to build

#### With CMake (recommended)
``` Shell
	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DUSE_GTK=OFF ..
	make
	make install
```
#### With Makefile
``` Shell
	make
```
Use target `gtk2` or `gtk3` for separate build. Install target NOT support.

### Activation

Once the plugin is installed, restart (or start) deadbeef.
By default, this plugin will automatically replace default tray icon.
You can change this behaviour in plugins settings (open deadbeef's preference, select plugins tab,
select StatusNotifier plugin, select settings).

Note, that by default, this plugin automatically enables "hide tray icon" option in deadbeef's settings (if disabled)
on startup and restores it's value on shutdown. But if shutdown was not clean (appliaction crashed, killed or something like this)
then value for "hide tray icon" won't be restored.

`-DUSE_GTK` - Whether to build gtk2 verion or not. Default: ON
`-DUSE_GTK3` - Whether to build gtk3 verion or not. Default: ON
`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` - Where to install. Default: `/usr/local`

`-DLIB_INSTALL_DIR` - Name of system libdir. Default: `lib`
